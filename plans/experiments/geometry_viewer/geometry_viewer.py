"""Matplotlib drawing of an mbirtorch scan geometry, in five panels.

What this module is for.  ``geometry_scene.GeometryScene`` turns a tomography
model's numbers into points and polylines.  This module draws those primitives
so that a user can see the geometry: where the source and the detector sit,
where the reconstruction volume sits, which way the gantry turns, and whether
the volume projects inside the detector.  It owns no geometry of its own.
Every position it draws comes from the scene, and every number it prints comes
from ``GeometryScene.derived_quantities``.

The five panels.  ``GeometryFigure`` builds one figure with a 2 by 3 grid.  The
left column holds a 3D view for orientation.  The middle and right columns hold
a top view in the xy plane, a side view in the yz plane, a detector face in
index coordinates, and a text panel of derived numbers.  The four drawing
panels show one view of the scan at a time, and ``set_view`` moves to another.
The point where the central ray meets the detector is called the detector iso,
which is the name the group's reference slide uses, and the center of the
detector grid is called the detector center.  The detector face names its
markers in a legend, and that legend sits in the band under the panel rather
than inside it.  Inside the panel it covered the projected outlines and a
painted sinogram (Greg, 2026-09-11).

The picture drawn.  The object stays fixed and the source and the detector
carry the view's motion, which is how a scanner user thinks of a scan.  The
projector code does the opposite, and the scene handles the conversion.

The display convention: negative z is the top of every panel.  Array indices
increase from top to bottom when an array is printed or shown, and the slice
index k runs along +z, so a drawing with -z at the top shows the volume the way
its array is indexed and the way ``imshow`` shows one slice (Greg,
2026-09-10).  The object frame itself does not change.  It stays right-handed
with +z along the increasing slice index, and every primitive the scene reports
is unchanged.  Only the presentation changes: the three 2D panels invert the
axes that the convention turns around, and the 3D panel rolls its camera.  The
module constant :data:`Z_UP_SIGN` is the sign of the object-frame z that points
up the screen, and each panel reads it in one place, so setting it to +1 draws
+z up again.

The screen orientation of each panel.  The reference picture is the group's
slide "Parallel Beam Geometry - top view", from Balke et al., Separable Models
for cone-beam MBIR Reconstruction, 2018.  In it the beam runs from left to
right, with the source on the left and the detector on the right.  Every panel
here follows that picture.  The top view is the xy plane seen from -z, with y
increasing to the left and x increasing downward.  The side view is the yz
plane seen from +x, with y increasing to the left and z increasing downward.
The detector face has the channel index increasing to the right and row 0 at
the top, which is the view from the source toward the detector.  In all three
the source of a view at angle 0 is on the left.

The 3D camera.  The default camera sits 25 degrees above the drawing's top,
which is the -z side, and 40 degrees off the +x axis toward -y, and it is
rolled by 180 degrees so that -z is up.  From there the 3D picture agrees with
the top view.  The y axis runs to the left, the x axis runs down the screen,
-z is up, and the source of a view at angle 0 sits at the back on the left.
The 40 degrees off the x axis matter.  Near an azimuth of zero the eye looks
along x, so the x axis and the z axis both run up and down the screen and the
detector stands edge on.  A detector that is upright is then hard to tell from
one lying flat.  The camera can be dragged with the mouse, and ``set_view``
keeps whatever camera the user has set.

Why that camera is rolled.  The roll is what inverts this panel's z, in place
of a reversed pair of z limits.  Reversed limits invert the z axis too, and
matplotlib draws them by flipping the z axis of the world it projects.  That
flip mirrors the picture.  The depth matplotlib sorts its artists by, and the
faces of the axes box it draws, then belong to an eye on the other side of the
object, and the x and y tick labels move over the panel's title.  The roll
turns the same view upside down instead.  The panel then stays a picture taken
from one viewpoint, and its z ticks read negative at the top.

The widgets.  A slider under the panels steps through the views, and six
toggles sit beside it in two rows of three.  The top row changes the drawing of
the geometry.  Its first toggle turns the source's path over all views on and
off.  Its second switches the 3D panel between the whole scan and a close view
of the volume, because a 12 ALU volume drawn to scale in a 200 ALU scan is
twenty pixels wide.  Its third turns the angle-0 reference on and off.  The
bottom row turns each of the three overlays on and off: the sinogram, the
phantom, and the comparison.  An overlay the figure does not hold has a toggle
all the same, so that an array added later has its toggle ready.  The widgets
follow the slice viewer of ``mbirtorch/viewer.py``: an integer-stepped
``Slider`` with ``drawon`` off, and ``CheckButtons`` for the toggles.

The labels.  The source and the detector carry a short text label in the 3D
view, the top view, and the side view.  The detector iso carries one in the 3D
view and the top view, and the detector's pixel-0 marker carries one in the top
view.  Each label names the element it sits beside, which one panel's legend
cannot do for the other panels (Greg, 2026-09-09).  A label moves with the
element it names, so it is a moving artist like that element.  The labels of
one panel are placed so that no two of them overlap and none reaches outside
the panel, which a test checks by measuring them.

The angle-0 reference.  The source and the detector are drawn a second time,
where they sit when the view action is the identity.  That position comes from
``GeometryScene.reference_view``.  These artists do not move with the slider,
so they show the current view against a fixed one, and the dotted arrow through
them is the direction the geometry projects at angle 0.  They are drawn dotted
and partly transparent in the 3D view and the top view, and the third toggle
turns them off.  The top view names them with a caption in its upper left
corner, because the ray they lie on crosses the middle of that panel, where the
labels of the source and the detector are.

How a redraw stays fast.  Every artist is created once and its data is replaced
in place, so a view change calls ``set_data`` and never ``clear``.  The panel
limits are computed from a sample of views and then held, so the ticks, the
grids, the legends, and the text block belong to a background that a view
change does not touch.  A view change restores that background, redraws only
the artists that moved, and blits, which is the same partial-redraw idea the
slice viewer uses.  Anything that changes the background instead, such as a
toggle or a new comparison, repaints the whole figure.  ``gv4_timing.md``
records what the two paths cost on an 1800-view helical scan.

The comparison overlay.  A second geometry can be drawn over the first in one
color with dashed lines, from a second scene, a second model, or a dictionary
of parameter overrides.  This is the calibration use: a vendor geometry against
the same geometry with an estimated offset.  The text panel then lists the
parameters that differ, which are what the user changed, and counts the derived
quantities that differ.  A second window holds the whole table, one row per
difference, with the primary geometry's value beside the comparison's.  The
table has no cap of its own, because the window's height follows its row count.

The data overlays.  Two arrays can be drawn beside the geometry, and both are
optional.  A sinogram is painted on the detector face, one view at a time, in
gray with row 0 at the top, so that the object's shadow can be read against the
projected outlines drawn over it.  A reconstruction or a phantom is drawn as a
silhouette in the volume box of the top view and the side view: the voxels
whose absolute value is above a threshold, projected along the axis the panel
does not draw.  The sinogram moves with the slider and the silhouette does not,
because the object is the thing this drawing holds fixed.

The phantom's outline.  The silhouette's fill is light, so that the lines drawn
over it stay readable, and against a busy panel it can be hard to see.  Each of
the two projected panels therefore also draws the outline of the support, as a
solid line through the outer faces of the voxels in it.  The 3D panel draws a
dashed outline of the support instead, which is the one thing that panel shows
of the phantom.  That outline follows the support one slice at a time, because
a phantom need not be a box.  mbirtorch's cube phantom is a rectangle that
steps sideways from one slice to the next, so its bounding box is larger than
the phantom and the wrong shape (Greg, 2026-09-11).  The detector face draws
that same outline projected onto it.  The projected outline says where the
phantom's shadow falls, against the outlines of the volume box and of the
region of reconstruction already drawn there.  All of these belong to the
phantom's toggle, and they are removed when the phantom is.

Import discipline.  This module imports numpy and the matplotlib base package
at import time, and nothing else.  ``pyplot``, the widgets, and the 3D toolkit
are imported inside :func:`_load_pyplot`, on the first figure construction.
Importing this module therefore never resolves a matplotlib backend and never
touches a GUI toolkit, which is the rule ``mbirtorch/viewer.py`` follows.

Colors.  One color per element, listed in :data:`COLORS`, is used in every
panel where the element appears.  The two index markers are the ones to look at
first: the marker at detector pixel (row 0, channel 0) and the marker at voxel
(0, 0, 0) show the index orientation of the data, and a mirrored channel order
or a wrong offset sign is visible from those two alone.

    views on and off, :meth:`set_zoom` switches the 3D panel between the whole

    on and off, and :meth:`set_compare` overlays a second geometry.  The slider
    and the six toggles under the panels call the same methods.
    :meth:`set_sinogram` paints a sinogram on the detector face and
    :meth:`set_recon` draws a reconstruction's silhouette in the volume box.

    Each of the three overlays has a toggle of its own as well:
    :meth:`set_show_sinogram`, :meth:`set_show_recon`, and
    :meth:`set_show_compare` hide the artists of one overlay and show them

    rebuilding, and an overlay that is hidden keeps whatever array or second
    geometry it was given.

    This class calls no matplotlib window function.  Use :meth:`save` to write
    a file, :meth:`show` to open a window, or :func:`show_geometry` to do both
    steps at once.

    Args:
        model_or_scene: a ``GeometryScene``, or a ``TomographyModel`` from
            which one is built with ``GeometryScene.from_model``.
        view_index (int, optional): the view to draw.  Defaults to 0.
        show_trajectory (bool, optional): whether to draw the source's path
            over all views.  Defaults to False.
        figsize (tuple, optional): the figure size in inches.
        title (str, optional): the figure's suptitle.  Defaults to a line
            naming the geometry kind and the model's shapes.
        elevation_deg, azimuth_deg (float, optional): the initial 3D camera.
        compare (optional): a second geometry to draw over the first.  A
            ``GeometryScene``, a ``TomographyModel``, or a dictionary of
            parameter overrides applied to a copy of this scene's parameters,
            for example ``dict(det_channel_offset=12.5)``.  None draws no
            comparison.
        zoom (str, optional): the 3D panel's zoom, one of :data:`ZOOM_MODES`.
        show_reference (bool, optional): whether to draw the source and the
            detector at their angle-0 position as a fixed reference.  Defaults
            to True.
        widgets (bool, optional): whether to build the slider and the three
            toggles.  Defaults to True.
        blit (bool, optional): whether a view change may use the partial-redraw
            fast path.  Defaults to True.  False forces a full repaint per
            change, which is slower and is the reference the timing script
            compares against.
        sinogram (array_like, optional): a sinogram of shape
            ``(num_views, num_det_rows, num_det_channels)``, painted on the
            detector face one view at a time.  None (default) paints none.
        recon (array_like, optional): a reconstruction or a phantom of shape
            ``recon_shape``, drawn as a silhouette in the volume box of the top
            view and the side view.  None (default) draws none.
        recon_threshold (float, optional): the absolute value above which a
            voxel belongs to that silhouette.  None (default) uses
            :data:`DEFAULT_RECON_THRESHOLD_FRACTION` of the largest absolute
            value in ``recon``.
        show_sinogram (bool, optional): whether the painted sinogram is drawn.
            Defaults to True.
        show_recon (bool, optional): whether the phantom's silhouette and
            outlines are drawn.  Defaults to True.
        show_compare (bool, optional): whether the comparison's artists are
            drawn in the four drawing panels.  Defaults to True.

    Attributes:
        scene (GeometryScene): the geometry drawn.
        compare_scene (GeometryScene or None): the second geometry drawn.
        figure: the matplotlib ``Figure``.
        compare_figure: the second matplotlib ``Figure``, which tables every
            difference between the two geometries, or None when no comparison
            is drawn.  It is created when a comparison is installed and closed
            when the comparison is removed.
        panel_axes (tuple): the five axes, in the order 3D view, top view, side
            view, detector face, text panel.
        view_slider: the view ``Slider``, or None when the scan has one view or
            ``widgets`` is False.
        trajectory_check, zoom_check, reference_check, sinogram_check,
            recon_check, compare_check: the six ``CheckButtons``, or None when
            ``widgets`` is False.
        detector_volume_edges (ndarray): the twelve projected volume edges the
            detector-face panel drew, (12, 2, 2), as (row, channel) pairs taken
            from ``ViewScene.volume_outline_on_detector``.

        and the last of each range.  The six polylines are then the rectangle
        of the first such slice at that slice's lower face, the rectangle of
        the last such slice at its upper face, and one rail per corner.  A rail
        runs through its corner's position in every slice that holds support,
        taken at the slice's center, and it starts and ends at the two end
        rectangles' corners.  A slice with no support voxel is skipped.

        A support whose bounding rectangle is the same in every slice gives
        four straight rails, and the outline is then the support's bounding
        box.  A support that steps sideways gives rails that follow the steps.

        fractional voxel indices, so the viewer computes no position of its
        own.

    It is used the way ``mbirtorch.slice_viewer`` is used: one call opens the
    window, and ``block`` decides whether the call waits for the window to
    close.

    The window shows five panels for one view of the scan: a 3D view, a top
    view of the xy plane, a side view of the yz plane, the detector face in row
    and channel index, and the derived numbers.  A slider steps through the
    views, and six toggles sit beside it.  Three of them turn the source's
    path, the 3D zoom to the volume, and the angle-0 reference on and off, and
    three turn the sinogram, the phantom, and the comparison on and off.  Every
    panel draws negative z at the top, and the beam runs from the source on the
    left to the detector on the right.  Two arrays can be drawn beside the
    geometry: a sinogram on the detector face and a reconstruction's silhouette
    in the volume box.

    Args:
        model_or_scene: a ``TomographyModel`` or a ``GeometryScene``.
        view_index (int, optional): the view to draw first.  Defaults to 0.
        show_trajectory (bool, optional): whether to draw the source's path
            over all views.  Defaults to False.
        compare (optional): a second geometry drawn dashed over the first: a
            ``GeometryScene``, a model, or a dictionary of parameter overrides
            such as ``dict(det_channel_offset=12.5)``.  Defaults to None.  A
            comparison opens a second window, which tables every difference
            between the two geometries.
        show_reference (bool, optional): whether to draw the source and the
            detector at their angle-0 position.  Defaults to True.
        zoom (str, optional): ``'scan'`` (default) fits the source, the
            detector, and the volume in the 3D panel; ``'volume'`` fits the
            volume.
        title (str, optional): the figure title.  None (default) names the
            geometry and the shapes.
        figsize (tuple, optional): the figure size in inches.
        elevation_deg, azimuth_deg (float, optional): the 3D camera.
        sinogram (array_like, optional): a sinogram of shape
            ``(num_views, num_det_rows, num_det_channels)``, painted on the
            detector face for the view drawn.  Defaults to None, which paints
            none.
        recon (array_like, optional): a reconstruction or a phantom of shape
            ``recon_shape``, drawn as a silhouette in the volume box of the top
            view and the side view.  Defaults to None, which draws none.
        recon_threshold (float, optional): the absolute value above which a
            voxel belongs to that silhouette.  Defaults to None, which uses
            :data:`DEFAULT_RECON_THRESHOLD_FRACTION` of the largest absolute
            value in ``recon``.
        show_sinogram (bool, optional): whether the sinogram starts drawn.
            Defaults to True.  Its toggle turns it on and off.
        show_recon (bool, optional): whether the phantom starts drawn.
            Defaults to True.
        show_compare (bool, optional): whether the comparison starts drawn.
            Defaults to True.
        block (bool, optional): If True (default), block until the window is
            closed.  If False, leave the window open and return immediately;
            the window becomes fully interactive when the next blocking call
            runs, and that blocking call closes every earlier nonblocking
            window when it returns.

    Returns:
        GeometryFigure: the figure.  Nonblocking callers may keep it to change
        the view or save an image; a module-level registry also keeps it alive
