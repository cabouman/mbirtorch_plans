"""Headless tests for the widgets, the zoom, and the comparison overlay.

These are the Increment 4 additions to `geometry_viewer.py`.  The tests check
five things.  The view slider exists with the range the scan has, and moving it
changes what is drawn.  The trajectory toggle draws one polyline per panel and
not one marker per view.  The zoom toggle puts a cube around the volume on the
3D panel.  A comparison whose channel offset is ten channels larger draws its
projected volume outline ten channels over from the primary's and lists the
change in the text panel.  Removing the comparison removes its artists.

A comparison also opens a second figure, which tables every difference between
the two geometries.  The tests check what that table holds, that removing the
comparison closes the window, and that saving the figure writes the window
beside it.  The text panel keeps the parameters that differ and counts the
derived quantities.

A later group covers the two data overlays of Increment 5.  Passing None
removes an overlay and leaves the view change working.  The sinogram's image is
a moving artist, animated exactly where the other moving artists are, and the
silhouette's two images are static.  The phantom's outline on the detector face
is a moving artist as well, and a view change puts it somewhere else.  All of
them come through a comparison being added and removed.  The last of them
measures the Increment 4 timing gate again with a sinogram drawn: a slider step
on the 1800-view scan of `gv4_timing.py` must stay under 100 ms.

A later group covers the three overlay toggles of 2026-09-11.  Each toggle
hides the artists of its own overlay and no others, and the state of each
toggle follows its ``set_show_`` method and a click on the widget.  A toggle
whose overlay is absent is built all the same and does nothing.  Hiding the
sinogram takes its note out of the detector panel's title, and hiding the
comparison leaves its numbers in the text panel.  The last of them renders the
figure: a sinogram hidden and then stepped past twice must leave the detector
panel's own background on the screen, which is what the partial-redraw path
does with an artist that is animated and invisible at once.

Later tests cover the display-test follow-up of 2026-09-09.  The labels on the
source, the detector, and the pixel-0 marker exist in the panels that carry
them, they follow the source when the view changes, and they are animated
exactly when the other moving artists are.  The angle-0 reference is drawn in
the 3D view and the top view, it does not move with the view, it is never
animated, its toggle hides and shows it, and the panel limits hold it whether
or not it is drawn.

The tests run under the Agg backend and open no window.
