"""Drawable description of an mbirtorch scan geometry, in plain numpy.

What this module is for.  A tomography model holds numbers: distances, pitches,
offsets, and per-view angles or vectors.  A user cannot see a geometry error in
those numbers, but can see it in a picture.  This module turns the numbers into
the points, lines, and polylines a picture needs.  It imports numpy only, so
every geometric statement it makes can be tested without a display.

The two layers.  ``GeometryScene`` is the model layer: it holds the parameters,
maps object points to detector indices, and returns the primitives for one
view.  A separate matplotlib module draws those primitives and owns the widgets.
This split follows the slice viewer of ``mbirtorch/viewer.py``, whose pure-numpy
``VolumeStack`` carries all of the data logic.

Every geometric statement a drawing makes is made here.  The drawing layer
places primitives on axes and computes no positions of its own, so this module
also carries the two drawings that are annotations rather than geometry: the
rays of a geometry whose source is infinitely far away, and the arc that shows
which way the source travels.

The object frame.  All four geometries share one right-handed (x, y, z) frame
whose z axis is the rotation axis.  Voxel (i, j, k) of the reconstruction sits
at

    x = delta_voxel * (j - (num_cols - 1) / 2)
    y = delta_voxel_row * (i - (num_rows - 1) / 2)
    z = delta_voxel_slice * (k - (num_slices - 1) / 2) + recon_slice_offset

with ``delta_voxel_row = voxel_row_aspect * delta_voxel`` and
``delta_voxel_slice = voxel_slice_aspect * delta_voxel``.  The volume is
centered on the origin in x and y.

Two pictures of the same geometry.  The projector moves the object and holds the
source and the detector fixed.  A scanner user thinks of the object as fixed and
the gantry as moving.  This module computes detector indices in the projector's
picture, because that is what the projector does, and returns drawable
primitives in the user's picture, because that is what a drawing needs.  The
conversion is the inverse of the view's action on the object.

One more view is drawable beside the scan's own views.  ``reference_view``
returns the primitives of the position the view action's identity gives, which
is the source and the detector at angle 0.  A drawing uses it as a fixed
reference for the view it shows.

Two positions in a drawing are choices and not geometry.  A parallel projection
has no source position, and a cone geometry with an infinite source-detector
distance has neither a source nor a detector position.  Both cases place the
source and the detector at a distance derived from the volume's size; see
``drawing_distance``.

The conventions this module implements are recorded, and confirmed against the
projector, in ``geometry_conventions.md`` of the geometry viewer plan directory.

    and the detector carry the view's motion.

    Attributes:
        view_index (int): the view these primitives belong to.
        source (ndarray or None): the source position, (3,).  None for a
            geometry whose source is infinitely far away, which is the parallel
            and multiaxis geometries and a cone geometry with an infinite
            source-detector distance.
        source_draw (ndarray): a source position that is always finite, (3,).
            Equal to ``source`` when that exists.  Otherwise a point one
            drawing distance back along the ray direction, which is a drawing
            choice.
        ray_direction (ndarray): unit vector, (3,), pointing from the source
            toward the detector along the central ray.
        detector_center (ndarray): the physical center of the detector grid,
            (3,).  This is the point at detector coordinates
            (u, v) = (-det_channel_offset, -det_row_offset), which is not on
            the central ray when either offset is nonzero.
        detector_origin (ndarray): the point where the central ray meets the
            detector, (3,), which is detector coordinates (0, 0).
        detector_u_axis (ndarray): unit vector, (3,), along which the channel
            index increases.  For a curved detector this is the tangent to the
            cylinder at the central ray.
        detector_v_axis (ndarray): unit vector, (3,), along which the row index
            increases.
        detector_normal (ndarray): unit vector, (3,), equal to
            ``ray_direction`` for a flat detector.
        detector_outline (ndarray): closed polyline through the detector's
            physical corners, (M, 3).  Five points for a flat panel.  For a
            curved detector, the bottom edge sampled along the arc, the top
            edge sampled back, and a repeat of the first point.
        detector_corners (ndarray): the four physical corners, (4, 3), in the
            order (low channel, low row), (high channel, low row), (high
            channel, high row), (low channel, high row).
        detector_pixel0 (ndarray): the physical center of detector pixel
            (row 0, channel 0), (3,).
        volume_corners (ndarray): the eight outer corners of the volume box,
            (8, 3).  These sit on the outer faces of the corner voxels, half a
            voxel beyond the corner voxel centers.
        voxel0_center (ndarray): the center of voxel (0, 0, 0), (3,).
        rotation_axis (ndarray or None): a segment along the rotation axis,
            (2, 3), spanning the volume's z extent and a little past it.  None
            for the translation geometry, which does not rotate.
        translation_path (ndarray or None): the path of the projector frame's
            origin through the object, (V, 3), for the translation geometry.
            This is the line the central ray sweeps through the object, and it
            takes the rotation axis's place in a drawing.  None otherwise.
        corner_rays (ndarray): four segments ending at the four detector
            corners, (4, 2, 3), in the same corner order as
            ``detector_corners``.  A geometry with a finite source gets four
            segments that start at that source.  A parallel-type geometry gets
            four segments parallel to ``ray_direction``, each starting in the
            plane through ``source_draw``, so a parallel-type corner ray is as
            long as the drawn central ray.  Rays that converged on
            ``source_draw`` would draw a cone beam, which is the picture the
            Increment 3 review rejected.
        volume_outline_on_detector (ndarray): the detector indices of the eight
            volume corners, (8, 2), as (row, channel).
        ror_outline_on_detector (ndarray or None): the detector indices of the
            region of reconstruction's two rims, (2, RIM_SAMPLES, 2), as
            (row, channel).  Entry 0 is the rim at ``z_min`` and entry 1 the
            rim at ``z_max``, each a closed polyline whose last point repeats
            its first.  The two rims bound the whole cylinder's projection, for
            the reason :meth:`GeometryScene.fit_points` gives.  None when there
            is no cylinder, which is the case ``ror_cylinder`` reports as None.
        ror_cylinder (dict or None): the region of reconstruction, when
            ``use_ror_mask`` is True.  Keys: ``center`` (3,), ``semi_axis_x``,
            ``semi_axis_y``, ``radius``, ``z_min``, ``z_max``.  None when the
            mask is off or is a custom array.
        rotation_direction_arc (ndarray or None): a short arc on the circle the
            source travels, (M, 3), starting at ``source_draw`` and sweeping
            ``ROTATION_ARC_SWEEP`` radians in the direction the source moves
            from this view to the next one.  The last two points give the
            direction an arrowhead at the end of the arc should point.  None
            for the translation geometry, which does not rotate, and None when
            the direction cannot be told: a single view, two neighboring views
            at one angle, or a source on the rotation axis.
        source_travel_sense (str or None): the same direction in words, either
            ``CLOCKWISE_FROM_PLUS_Z`` or ``COUNTERCLOCKWISE_FROM_PLUS_Z``.
            None exactly when ``rotation_direction_arc`` is None.

        The statement is geometric and ignores the projector's point spread, so

        Two rules are used.  A scan that does not travel along the axis is
        asked whether the fit shape lands on the detector in every view.  A
        helical cone scan is asked something else, because its volume is taller
        than one view's detector by design and so leaves the detector in every
        view.  It is asked whether the shape stays inside the detector's
        channel range, and whether the detector's axial coverage sweeps the
        whole volume over the scan.

        The axial coverage of one view is worked out from
        :meth:`project_points` and not from a second formula.  The two points
        (0, 0, z_min) and (0, 0, z_max) on the line x = y = 0 are projected,
        and the row index is an affine function of z along that line in every

        at row -0.5 and at row ``num_det_rows`` - 0.5.  That pair of z values
        is the view's coverage.  For the translation geometry the line
        x = y = 0 is not a rotation axis, because that geometry does not

            ``z_extent_covered``: whether every z of :meth:`volume_z_range`
            lies in the union of the per-view coverage intervals.  The union is
